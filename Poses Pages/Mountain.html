            <h3>Follow these Steps:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Come onto your hands and knees, with your hands a tiny bit in front of your shoulders and your knees directly below your hips. Spread your palms, rooting down through all four corners of your hands, and turn your toes under.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Exhale and lift your knees from the floor, at first keeping your knees slightly bent and your heels lifted off the floor. Lengthen your tailbone away from the back of your pelvis, lift the sitting bones toward the ceiling, and draw your inner legs from your inner ankles up through your groins.</li>
                <br>
                <li>On an exhalation, push your top thighs back and stretch your heels toward the floor. Straighten your knees without locking them.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Firm your outer arms and press the bases of your index fingers actively into the floor. Lift along your inner arms from the wrists to the tops of the shoulders. Firm your shoulder blades against your back, then widen them and draw them toward your tailbone. Keep your head between your upper arms.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Stay in the pose for 10 or more breaths, then bend your knees on an exhalation and lower yourself into Childâ€™s Pose</li>
              </ul>
