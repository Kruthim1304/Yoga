            <h3>Follow these Steps:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Bend one leg at the knee. Choose the leg you are going to fold in first. If your left leg is your standing leg, keep your left foot planted on the ground, and slowly bend in your right leg at the right knee so that the sole of your right foot rests against your left inner thigh (known as the half-lotus position in Bikram yoga). Point the knee of your bent leg outward, away from your body.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Lengthen your body. Clasp your hands together in Anjali Mudra (also called the “prayer position”)</li>
                <br>
                <li>Hold and repeat. Hold the pose for as long as necessary, making sure to breathe properly. When you’re ready to switch legs, exhale, and return to mountain pose to start again.</li>
                <br>
              </ul>
